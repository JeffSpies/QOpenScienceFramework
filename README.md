# osf-api-pyqt-widgets
This repository contains a set of PyQt widgets (should work with both pyqt4 and pyqt5 thanks to qtpy) that are designed
to display and interact with information obtained through the Open Science Framework API. The module therefore requires
[this library](https://github.com/dschreij/osf-api-python-interface) to work correclty.

- qtpy (https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy)
- qtawesome (https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtawesome)
- requests_oauthlib (https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib)
